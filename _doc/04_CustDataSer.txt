- The goal here is that we do not want to just
  return the entities retrieved from the db;
  we want to transform them to DTOs instead
  before sending them back to the client
  - remove sensitive properties from the
    entities like password
  - for the same entity return different 
    set of properties based on permissions

- define DTOs
  - use @Expose() do configure which properties
    to include in the response #04-01

- Interceptors
  - can mess around with incoming requests and/or
    outgoing responses
  - can be applied to a single handler, all the
    handlers in a controller, or globally
  - define a constructor to take in the type of
    the DTO so the Interceptor will know 
    what to produce #04-02
  - define a intercept method and perform the
    actual transformation there #04-03

- Custom decorator
  - define a custom decorator to make passing in DTO
    type info to the Interceptor a bit easier #04-04

- Configure the controller to use the Interceptor
