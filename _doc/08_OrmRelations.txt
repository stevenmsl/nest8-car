- goal 
  - implement one-to-many relations in TypeORM
  - make sure the response does not have 
    sensitive data like password

- define relations in entities
  - from user to report; one to many relation #08-01
  - from report to user; many to one relation #08-02
  - inevitably you are going to have a circular
    references when defining relations: User type needs 
    to import Report type and vice versa
    - this means User and Report types will not be
      available at the same time during importing
    - this potential type undefined issue can be resolved
      by passing in a function that returns the type needed  
      to the decorator #08-03
      - by the time you call () => User, the type
        User should be available already

- define DTOs for validations and transformation
  - validations #08-04
  - transformation #08-05

- report service
  - create a report and specify the user 
    before saving it #08-06

- run it #08-07
