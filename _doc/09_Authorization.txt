- goal 
  - implement authorization to protect permission-based APIs

- Guards, interceptors, and middlewares
  - requests flow through middlewares, guards, and then
    interceptors.
  - since we implement authorization as guards, 
    we need to convert the current user interceptor
    into a middleware. This will allow us to put the
    user info in the requests before they arrive at 
    the authorization guard #09-01
   
- current user middleware
  - augment the express Request interface #09-02
  - configure the middle to be available for 
    all routes #09-03

- admin guard
  - add admin property to the user entity #09-04
  - implement the authorization logic #09-05
     
- controller
  - apply AdminGuard for authorization #09-06

- test #09-07
